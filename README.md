Notes:

### Override buttons

Override buttons are useful because they give the user manual control over the system rather than relying only on automation.

- If automation makes a bad decision, users can manually adjust behavior.
`Example: If the system incorrectly redirects water when storage is needed, the user can override and store rainwater manually.`
- In case of unexpected conditions (e.g., rapid weather changes), users can respond faster than automation.
`Example: A sudden storm causes flooding, so the user overrides the system to redirect rainwater immediately.`
- Not every user wants strict automationâ€”having overrides makes the system more user-friendly.
`Example: Some users prefer to store rainwater regardless of weather trends, while others prioritize irrigation needs.`
